            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>Below are links for more info about what I Learned while taking a summer Web Design Studio class.I am also using this about page so I can just write some random stuffs since why not and I'm not even sure what I am writing at this point which is weird since I normally know exactly what I am doing. No. That is a lie, I literally never know what I am doing, like ever. Okay I'm pretty sure I have written wayyyyyy too much since I can't even see any code anymore, but that is probably normal. How would I know though, I was at the dentist for more than half of the class. Does that matter in the big scheme of life? I don't think I am spelling scheme corretly lol. It doesn't matter either. Well, that's what I think. Everyone is just a very small dot in the whole unviverse, why does it matter in the big plan of the world, or the unviverse, or everything that has been created by whatever caused this place. Look, now I can actually see the rest of my writing that is so cool. Apparently, it was easier than I though which is not surprising considering I haven't used a computer for like 3 or 4 years. Saying-typing-that sounds so pathetic h e h e. Well, I have currently written 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 lines of writing/code or whatever this is, and my hands are getting tired of writing nothing so I shall part from writing my about page thing even though it is sadly addictive. Jesus that sounded weird. Okay, godbye.</p>
